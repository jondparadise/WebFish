# WebFish
Beginnings of a StockFish driven web API

This project was pulled from an archived local repo on my dev machine. It is not a finished product and was intended as a proof of concept. I wanted to build a NET API that consumed StockFish chess engine to provide a backend AI for a chess program.

A user on reddit was looking to do a similar project, so I've provided this solution as a sample implementation.
